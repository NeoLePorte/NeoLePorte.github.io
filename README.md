WebDev Portfolio

This is my portfolio made to hold projects I work on. Built with Vue.js as a way to get to know the vue framework/webpack
and buld something useful at the same time.page routing is done with vue router,  Axios for the api calls for the codepen data used in the projects page, and aframe for the webvr scene in the contacts page. there are a few bugs but its fully functional.

To run: 
clone the project
open project in editor of choice
"NPM install"
use "http-server" from console to run locally so aframe scene and codesplit bundles load correctly.

if you want to experiment with anything use "npm run build:dev" to bundle project.

**works on everything even IE!(excluding webVR scene)**
