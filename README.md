WebDev Portfolio

This is my portfolio made to hold projects I work on. Built with Vue.js as a way to get to know the vue framework/webpack
and buld something useful at the same time.page routing is done with vue router,  Axios for the api calls for the codepen data used in the projects page, and aframe for the webvr scene in the contacts page. there are a few bugs but its fully functional for the most part.

To run: 
clone the project
NPM install
 launch page through index.html.

if you want to experiment with anything use "npm run build:dev" to bundle project.

**works on everything but IE at the moment. working on it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯**
